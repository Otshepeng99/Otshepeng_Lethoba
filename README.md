The functionalities of the web page is shown clearly on the screenshots below. 

The first page of my web page(Home) has my profile picture and  moving elements to create an interesting appearance. The navigation bar has a Resume, Logo(My name and surname), Contacts,About and Projects. The navigation bar has a hovering functionality applied to it on all the link tabs except for the logo.

Clicking "Resume" will open the pdf file of my CV. The screenshot is shown below.

When Projects is clicked, the screen zooms the moving element(svg) on the right side of my picure and shows details of my academic projects

The "About" tab functions the same way as the "Projects" tab with the difference being that it zooms on the  "About" tab where it shows a short information about myself.

The downside about the zoom-in animation is that i have to refresh everytime i want to zoom out because i struggled to implement a zoom out functionality.
The two screenshots below shows what happens when you click on "Contacts". You will be redirected to a mail application that you have on your device with my email address displayed.
